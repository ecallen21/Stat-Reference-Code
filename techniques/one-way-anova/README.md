# One-Way ANOVA (Reference §3.8, §3.9)

Test whether the means of `k ≥ 2` groups are all equal. Three variants here, increasingly forgiving of unequal variances.

| Test | Assumes equal variances? | When |
|------|--------------------------|------|
| **Classic F** | Yes | All groups have similar SD; balanced or near-balanced design |
| **Welch's** | No | **Modern default** — robust to unequal variances; recommended unless you have strong reason to believe equal variances |
| **Brown–Forsythe F\*** | No | Alternative to Welch; uses a different df estimator |

## The math

Per-group statistics: `n_i`, `x̄_i`, `s_i²`. Grand mean: `x̄ = (Σ nᵢ x̄ᵢ) / N`.

**Classic**:
- `SS_between = Σ nᵢ (x̄ᵢ − x̄)²`
- `SS_within  = Σ (nᵢ − 1) sᵢ²`
- `F = (SS_b/(k−1)) / (SS_w/(N−k))` ~ `F(k−1, N−k)` under H₀.

**Welch**: weights `wᵢ = nᵢ / sᵢ²`, weighted grand mean `x̄_w = (Σ wᵢ x̄ᵢ) / Σwᵢ`. F = (weighted SS between) / (variance-correction term), with a Satterthwaite-style `df₂`.

**Brown–Forsythe**: same numerator as classic; denominator is `Σ (1 − nᵢ/N) sᵢ²`, with Satterthwaite `df₂`.

## Effect size

Always report alongside the p-value (see `techniques/effect-sizes` for full details and benchmarks):
- `η² = SS_between / SS_total` — upward-biased
- `ω² = (SS_b − (k−1)·MS_w) / (SS_total + MS_w)` — less biased
- Cohen's `f = √(η²/(1−η²))`

## What comes next

A significant overall ANOVA only says "at least one pair of means differs." To find **which** pairs, use a post-hoc procedure:
- equal variances → **Tukey HSD** (`techniques/post-hoc-tests`)
- unequal variances → **Games–Howell** (`techniques/post-hoc-tests`)
- treatments vs. a single control → **Dunnett** (`techniques/post-hoc-tests`)
- many pre-planned pairs → control the family-wise error or FDR (`techniques/multiple-comparisons`)

Check the assumptions before believing the result: **normality of residuals** (`techniques/normality-tests`) and **homogeneity of variance** (`techniques/homogeneity-of-variance`). If badly violated and groups can't be transformed: Kruskal–Wallis (Ch. 6, future batch) or a permutation test.

## Files
- `python/one_way_anova.py` — from-scratch classic, Welch, Brown–Forsythe (each with closed-form F and Satterthwaite df); compares against `scipy.stats.f_oneway`.
- `r/one_way_anova.R` — from-scratch versions + base `aov` (classic) and `oneway.test(var.equal = FALSE/TRUE)` (Welch / classic).
- `pyspark/one_way_anova.py` — distributed sufficient statistics (`groupBy → count/mean/var_samp`), closed-form F on the driver. Works for any `k`.
