# Outlier Tests (Reference §3.25)

Formal tests of "is this extreme value farther from the mean than we'd expect under a normal distribution?" — together with one widely used non-test heuristic (Tukey's IQR rule).

## Tests

| Test | Detects | Sample size |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Grubbs** | A single most-extreme value (one-sided or two-sided) | `n ≥ ~6` |
| **Generalized ESD** (Rosner) | Up to `r` outliers (iteratively masks the most extreme and re-tests) | `n ≥ 10`, ideal |
| **Dixon's Q** | A single outlier via gap/range; uses tabulated critical values | `3 ≤ n ≤ ~30` |
| **Tukey IQR rule** | Points outside `[Q1 − k·IQR, Q3 + k·IQR]` (`k=1.5` outlier, `k=3` "far out"). **Not** a hypothesis test — just a robust description. | any |

## Important caveats

- **"Outlier" ≠ "error".** Before deleting flagged points, *investigate*. The extreme value may be the most informative observation in the dataset.
- **These tests assume the rest of the data are normal.** On skewed or heavy-tailed data they over-flag — they'll declare a point in the long tail "an outlier" when it's perfectly typical for that distribution. Check normality first (`techniques/normality-tests`) or transform the data.
- **Better defaults than test-and-delete**: a robust statistical method (`techniques/robust-location-scale` — Yuen's trimmed t, Huber M-estimators, MAD) keeps every observation and just down-weights extreme ones.
- **Repeated retesting changes things.** After Grubbs flags and removes a point, running Grubbs again on the remaining data inflates the type-I error. Use Generalized ESD if you really expect multiple outliers.

## Tukey's IQR rule

The non-test version most people reach for: `lower = Q1 − 1.5·IQR`, `upper = Q3 + 1.5·IQR`. Robust, makes no normality assumption, doesn't pretend to be a hypothesis test. It's what's behind the "whiskers" in a standard boxplot (`Reference §1.10`, `§1.31`).

## Files
- `python/outlier_tests.py` — from-scratch Grubbs / Generalized ESD / Dixon's Q (with the standard tabulated critical values) / IQR rule. No library equivalent in stock scipy.
- `r/outlier_tests.R` — from-scratch + `outliers::grubbs.test`, `outliers::dixon.test`, `EnvStats::rosnerTest` for Generalized ESD.
- PySpark: N/A — these are sample-level tests. For large data, compute `Q1` / `Q3` via `approxQuantile` (`techniques/quantiles/pyspark/`) and apply the IQR rule as a filter.

## Run
```
python techniques/outlier-tests/python/outlier_tests.py
