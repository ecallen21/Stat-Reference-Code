# Regularization: Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net (Reference §5.9, §5.17)

All three add a penalty on the size of the coefficients to the OLS objective:

`minimize  RSS(β) + λ · Penalty(β)`

| Method | Penalty | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Ridge** (L2) | `Σ β_j²` | Shrinks toward 0; **never exactly zero**; handles collinearity gracefully |
| **Lasso** (L1) | `Σ \|β_j\|` | Shrinks AND **drops** variables (sparse solutions); arbitrarily picks one of a correlated group |
| **Elastic net** | `α·Σ\|β_j\| + (1−α)/2 · Σβ_j²` | Mix: keeps correlated groups together; `α=1` lasso, `α=0` ridge |

## Why standardize first

The penalty acts on raw coefficients. If `x₁` is in meters and `x₂` in kilometers, they take very different "amounts of penalty" for the same effect. Standard practice (followed throughout this file): **center and scale every column** before fitting, then back-transform. R's `glmnet` and sklearn's `Ridge`/`Lasso` standardize by default.

## Algorithms

- **Ridge** has a closed form: `β̂ = (X'X + λI)⁻¹ X'y`. Cheap.
- **Lasso** has **no closed form** because of the `|·|` corners. Standard solver: **cyclic coordinate descent with soft-thresholding** — for each coordinate, the update is

  `β_j ← S(z_j, λ/n)`,  where `z_j = ⟨x_j, r⟩/n` (residual without the `j`-th contribution) and `S(z, t) = sign(z) · max(0, |z|−t)` is the soft-threshold.

  Converges in `O(np · iter)`; iter is typically a few dozen.
- **Elastic net** uses the same loop with `β_j ← S(z_j, λα/n) / (1 + λ(1−α)/n)`.

## Choosing λ

Cross-validation (`cv_regularization` here): fit on `k − 1` folds, evaluate MSE on the held-out fold, average across folds. The CV-min λ is the standard choice; the "1-SE" rule picks the largest λ within 1 SE of the min (more parsimonious).

## When to use which

- **Pure prediction, all predictors potentially relevant** → ridge.
- **Pure prediction, many irrelevant predictors expected** → lasso (variable selection embedded).
- **Many correlated predictors and you want groups in/out together** → elastic net.
- **You want valid inference (CIs / p-values)** → all three are biased and getting calibrated inference is a research problem (post-selection inference, debiased lasso). For inference, prefer plain OLS with deliberate variable choice.

## Files
- `python/regularization.py` — from-scratch ridge (closed form), lasso (coordinate descent with soft-thresholding), elastic net (same loop with EN update), and `cv_regularization` for k-fold CV; compares against `sklearn.linear_model` Ridge / Lasso / ElasticNet.
- `r/regularization.R` — from-scratch versions + `glmnet::glmnet` and `glmnet::cv.glmnet` (the canonical implementation).
- `pyspark/regularization.py` — `pyspark.ml.regression.LinearRegression` with `regParam = λ` and `elasticNetParam = α`; ridge / lasso / elastic-net all dispatch from one model class.
